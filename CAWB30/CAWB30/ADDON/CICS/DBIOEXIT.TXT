This is a description of DBIO exits that are available in CA-Realia
CICS runtime.  These exits are made available to meet the specific
need of DB managers to gain access to CICS at various points in the
execution of CA-Realia CICS.  Although Computer Associates will
endevor to maintain the specifications of each exit in future
releases it reserves the right to change the characteristics of a
DBIO exit or to remove the exit from the product.

All DBIO exits are defined to CICS by including the correct DB
type and program name in the Region Initialization file (REALCICS.CSR).

Code one of the following lines:

IMS=NO|YES|programID[,NOWARN[,acbgenname]]
XDB=NO|YES|programID[,NOWARN]
DATACOM=NO|YES|programID[,NOWARN]
IDMS=NO|YES|programID[,NOWARN]
DB2=NO|YES|programID[,[NO]WARN[,dbname[,username,password]]]
ODBC=NO|YES|programID[,[NO]WARN[,dbname[,username,password]]]

This value can also be set up as an environmental value. The
environment value name must be CACX_xxxx instead of just xxxx.
The environment value has precedence over the value in the CSR. The
string is paased to the exit during initialization.

Program Interface

All programs must follow these standards:

1) All user exit programs have a standard set of parameters.

2) The interface is CA-Realia CICS Specific and must be written in
   CA-Realia COBOL 60.

3) The user exit program should be derived from the supplied base
   program named DBIOEXIT.COB.

4) The program must be linked using the supplied LINKCICS batch file.

5) No EXEC CICS commands are permitted.

6) No file I/O to CICS data files is permitted unless CA supplies
   specific access routines for this purpose. No routines have been
   supplied at this time.

7) All CICS data areas passed will be in the ASCII codeset unless
   specifically noted.

8) The default program names if YES is coded are:

   IMS      | CACXIMS
   XDB      | CACXXDB
   DATACOM  | CACXDCOM
   IDMS     | CACXIDMS
   DB2      | CACXDB2
   ODBC     | CACXODBC

There is no internal difference between these modules except for the
default program name.  All can be included in the same session.  If
a different DB routine needs to be implimented then simply use one
of the names listed and provide the correct programID.

There is very little default processing.  If the DBIO program does
not want to be notified at the end of each LUW then the EXIT-CLASS variable
must be modified.  The default is to call the routine at start
and end of each LUW.

CA-Realia CICS supports SYNCHPOINT and ROLLBACK and the session
continues to operate after a transaction has ABENDED so we recommend
that the DBIO routines support the same level of operation.

Read DBIOEXIT.COB for specific implimentation notes.
