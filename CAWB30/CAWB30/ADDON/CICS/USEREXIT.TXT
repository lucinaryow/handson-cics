This is a description of user exits that are available in CA-Realia
CICS runtime. These exits are made available to meet the specific
need of users to gain access to CICS resources at various points in
the execution of CA-Realia CICS. Although Computer Associates will
endevor to maintain the specifications of each exit in future
releases it reserves the right to change the characteristics of
a user exit or to remove the exit from the product.

All User exits are defined to CICS by including the exit number and
program name in the System Initialization file (CACX.INI).  Code
the following line:

EXIT_nnn=PROGID
EXIT_ERROR=PROGID

This value can also be set up as an environmental value.  The
environment value has precedence over the value in the SIF.

Program Interface

All programs must be follow these standards:

1) All user exit programs have a standard set of parameters.

2) The interface is CA-Realia CICS Specific and must be written in
   CA-Realia COBOL 5.0.

3) The user exit program should be derived from the supplied base
   program named USEREXIT.COB.

4) The program must be linked using the supplied LINKCICS batch file.

5) No EXEC CICS commands are permitted.

6) No file I/O to CICS data files is permitted unless CA supplies
   specific access routines for this purpose. No routines have been
   supplied at this time.

7) All CICS data areas passed will be in the ASCII codeset unless
   specifically noted.

Currently suppported Exits

==============

User_Exit_001  TCT DataStream Exit

This exit will be passed the address and size of the datastream
being used by Terminal Control processing before TCP does any
processing (CICS-BEFORE-TASK) . This will be the address of the raw
datastream in ASCII and it's size.  The exit can do what it wants
with this stream.  The address pointer and size variable can be
modifed to point to a new stream and the values in DFHEIBLK can be
revised.

The revised data stream will be used to determine the action for
Terminal Control Processing.

Sample program is EXIT_001.COB

==============
Exit_ERROR Error exception processing

This exit will be passed the addresses of EIBLK and CICSICB
being used by a specific command. It is the responsibility of this
exit to process the error. Currently this routine is called under
these conditions:

1) Invalid SYSID:       EIBRESP = SYSIDERR
2) Unsupported command: EIBRESP = INVREQ EIBRESP2=200

It is the exit program's responsibility to set or reset
EIBRECODE, EIBRESP, EIBRESP2  and other values in EIBLK.
The value in EIBRESP after return from the exit will be used
to process the ERROR Condition.

==============
File Access exits.

Refer to DBIOEXIT.TXT for description of file management exits.
