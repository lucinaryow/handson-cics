CA-Realia II Workbench Release 3.0
COBOL Component "ReadMe"
20 June 1997


This file supplements the documentation provided with this release.


Corrections
===========

1)  The printed documentation for the ORAPI Run-Unit Management
    function RealiaCobolUserExitProc is somewhat mangled.  Please
    refer to the online book for the correct documentation.

2)  The documentation lists both MSVCRT.DLL and MSVCRT40.DLL as
    required executables for the proper execution of a COBOL
    application.  However, in the final product, MSVCRT40.DLL is
    no longer required.

3)  This product includes an emulation of the Date and Time Callable
    Services as documented by IBM in the "Language Env V1R5 Programming
    Reference" (document number: SC26-3312-02).  The implementation is
    complete with the exception of national language support for month
    and day of week names.  These routines are run-mode EBCDIC programs
    linked as CEE3CTY.DLL.  To use these routines simply link with the
    standard Realia COBOL run-time import library, CARCLW60.LIB.


Issues
======

1)  The COBOL file system recognizes old 16-bit indexed files and
    automatically installs the compatibility module.  Therefore,
    when opening an existing 16-bit index file, it is not necessary
    to specify the [z:exit(carfsw16)] file type to read old 16-bit
    indexed files.  Note that opening an existing 16-bit indexed
    file for output will result in a new 32-bit (c-tree) indexed
    file.  When the NOFCREATE directive is in effect, the file
    attributes (keys and record lengths) will be preserved.

    To create an indexed file in the old 16-bit format the
    [z:exit(carfsw16)] file type must be specified.

2)  To ensure the best possible results under the debugger, programs
    compiled with beta versions of the COBOL compiler should be
    recompiled.  Programs that are not recompiled may not appear
    correctly under the debugger.
